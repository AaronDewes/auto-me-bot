Let alone managing multiple repositories used by multiple contributors and bots . My name is auto-me-bot ! I was created with Probot and I live my life as a serverless function residing in AWS Lambda . I'm here to take some of the load off your shoulders, just tell me what you want me to do... Place a file called auto-me-bot.yml in your .github folder in the repos you want me to help out with. Installation \u2693\ufe0e Install me from GitHub marketplace and select the repos you want me to keep an eye out for. Events I work with pull_request Permissions I require scope permission checks write metadata read pull_requests read metadata:read is mandatory. Configuration \u2693\ufe0e I take my instructions in yaml . If I can't find my configuration file in the repo I'm working with, I'll look for it in your .github repo. .github/auto-me-bot.yml --- pr : conventionalCommits : # (1) signedCommits : # (2) tasksList : # (3) this means I'll enforce conventional commit messages in PRs. this means I'll make sure all commits in PRs are signed with the 'Signed-off-by' trailer. this means I'll verify the completion of the tasks list in PRs. Look-See \u2693\ufe0e all handlers successful all handlers failed conventional commits successful conventional commits failed signed commits successful signed commits failed tasks list successful tasks lists failed tasks lists non-found Spec \u2693\ufe0e I was built with Probot . I was documented with Material for MkDocs . My art, i.e. my logo, was created with DiceBear . I'm deployed to AWS Lambda . My docs are deployed to GitHub Pages . My source code, of course, is stored on GitHub .
